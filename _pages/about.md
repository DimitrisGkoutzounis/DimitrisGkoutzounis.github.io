I am a graduate student pursuing a diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the Hellenic Mediterranean University. Over the years, my interests have evolved to include web development, machine learning, and, most notably, automation and control.

My research focuses on optimization procedures and reinforcement learning applications, particularly in robotics. I thrive in collaborative environments, embrace change with a positive mindset, and am always eager to learn and improve.

I am excited to apply my skills and knowledge into new challenges!
