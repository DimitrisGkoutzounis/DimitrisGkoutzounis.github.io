## **Diploma Thesis** ##

## **Learning-based control of Multi-Agent systems** ##
    
This is the implementation of my Diploma thesis "Learning-based control of multi-agent systems", which extends the SafeOpt algorithm to a multi-agent setting, utilizing the Quasar platform for experimental validation. The work focuses on safe and efficient optimization in a decentralized cooperative control scenario.

## **Key Contributions**
- **Extension of SafeOpt:** Expands the SafeOpt algorithm to a multi-agent environment.
- **Multi-Agent Safe Learning:** Implements decentralized safe learning for multiple agents interacting in a shared control task.
- **Quanser Platform Integration:** Deploys and evaluates the approach on the Quanser platform for real-world experimental validation.
