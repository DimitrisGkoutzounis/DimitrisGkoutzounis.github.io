## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the mass of electrons based on a dataset of particle collision events collected by CERN in 2010. These events, defined as electron collisions, resulted in a dataset of 100,000 events with invariant mass values ranging from 2 to 110 GeV.

Using **supervised learning**, we trained a predictive model on labeled data where the actual electron mass values were available. This approach enables the model to generalize and make accurate mass predictions for new, unseen collision events.
